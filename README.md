Welcome to my site! It uses [Deploy to Neocities](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities) to deploy any code I write here directly to [my Neocities site](https://missmoss.neocities.org). Feel free to use bits and pieces of my site to help make yours! 
Note that not all of the content here is created by me - things like buttons, stamps, and blinkies are likely not original. Please check my site for their sources and respect the original artists.
