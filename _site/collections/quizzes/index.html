        A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist
        first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect
        others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and
        challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not
        intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To
        do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to
        liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from
        himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but
        his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a
        bridge as to cross it. Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be
        because it represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and
        a do-gooder's zeal. However, chaotic neutral can be a dangerous
        alignment when it seeks to eliminate all authority, harmony, and order
        in society.<br />
        <br /><u>Race:</u><br /><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the
        common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and
        conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often
        unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful
        clothes, tattoos, and the like. <br /><br /><u>Class:</u><br /><b
          >Wizards</b
        >
        are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their
        magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art.
        When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to
        devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The
        wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is secondary. She
        learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she
        can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard
        learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are
        improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small,
        magical, animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence,
        wizards are capable of casting very high levels of spells.
